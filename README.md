# Final Project Template

KIEI-451 Winter 2021


Team members: Marissa Gordon, Karishma Ratnani

Project Description: We are doing idea #6 from the approved list of ideas:

An application to help larger groups plan a trip from start to finish.

Problem: Planning a trip in larger groups can be complicated and move slowly (especially if they happen over a group text), and often not take place due to lost inertia.

Solution: an app where groups can propose, vote for, and track trip components.
